 PPSCF - Parallel Polymer Self-Consistent Field Theory
 An parallelization extension of the original PSCF project. Just started!
 
 Features Added for PSCF: 
 1. Multiple parallelism (supporting MPI, Openmp, openacc, GPU CUDA)
 2. Advanced field iteration schemes(semi-implicit, andersion mixing etc) 
 3. Integration OpenArray for parallel data management.
 4. anything else that is interesting.

 PSCF - Polymer Self-Consistent Field Theory
 Copyright (2002-2016) Regents of the University of Minnesota

 PSCF is a Fortran 90 program for numerically solving the polymer 
 self-consistent field theory for periodic microstructures formed 
 by incompressible melts or mixtures of linear block copolymers, 
 linear homopolymers, and small molecule solvents.

 Dependencies:

 PSCF depends upon the FFTW fast Fourier transform library and the 
 LAPACK linear algebra library.  These packages must be installed 
 before attempting to compile the program from source.

 User Documentation:

 A web user manual is avalaible at:

    https://pscf.readthedocs.io

 Instructions for compiling the program from source, as well as various
 ways to install precompiled executables, are given in the user manual.

 The source files for the user manual are text files that are stored in 
 the doc/user-man directory. The relevant files have file extension .rst. 

 Developer Documentation:

 A local copy of the developer API documentation, which includes 
 documentation for all modules, subroutines and public variables, may 
 be regenerated by following instructions given in the file doc/README. 
 The resulting .html page are installed in doc/devel-man.

 An annotated list of source files is given in the file src/SRC_FILES. 
 Before modifying any fortran files, see the note at the end of that 
 file regarding the use of preprocessor to generate some files.
